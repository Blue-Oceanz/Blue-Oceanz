## Project Description <a name = "about_project"></a>

As a career manager, you may have noticed that it is difficult to find a software solution that easily enables you to track your client's progress in the job search arena. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to see which jobs they've applied to, where they are in the application process, and all the while, have a bird's eye view of analytics and trends of the client's progress?

With Blue Oceanz, you can! This simple application blends all these needs into a sleek and usable interface to get right to the information you need. Though still in production, when completed, this application will allow the user to register as either a job seeker or a career manager. 

Job seeker features:
- Add, move, and delete jobs from their job application tracking board
- Communicate directly with the career manager via comments on a particular application
- Review and add posted jobs in the opportunities tab to their application board
- Go directly to the job posting through links in the job description

Career manager features:
- All the same features as the job seeker
- Create an organization
- Add job seekers registered on the site their organization
- Post upcoming job opportunites to the opportunities page
- Filter analytics from data on their job seeker's progess (past and present job seekers)

git clone git@github.com:Blue-Oceanz/Blue-Oceanz.git
```
2. Install dependencies with npm installs in each folder (root, frontend, and restapi)
```sh
npm install
```
3. To spin up the docker containers for localhost
```sh
npm run buildup
```
4. You can now go to localhost:3000 to see the application

5. To stop the docker containers
```sh
npm run builddown
```

### Digital Ocean Deployment as Docker Swarm <a name = "install"></a>

#### Digital Ocean Droplet 

First sign up at DigitialOcean and create a new project. You can name the project anything you want, this is just and identifier. Click on ‚ÄòGet Started with a Droplet‚Äô and go through the following steps:

1. Select Ubuntu 18.04.x (LTS) x64.
2. Leave the Droplet on Standard.
3. Select the $5 per month option, you can always upgrade if required.
4. Skip adding block storage.
5. Select a data center.
6. Select additional options, I selected monitoring.
7. Leave authentication on SSH and add your key, see steps below if you don‚Äôt have a key yet.
8. Leave on 1 Droplet and rename it to something more memorable (optional).

Click on Create Droplet.

You should now see your droplet in the dashboard with its IP address, this is the address we‚Äôll need to SSH into the server.

NOTE: The Digital Ocean Droplet is a blank slate Ubuntu machine. You will need to install all desire packages and configurations. For example, if you want to use NPM... you need to install it.

References:
- [Digital Ocean](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/create/)
- [Deploying multiple dockerized apps](https://danielwachtel.com/devops/deploying-multiple-dockerized-apps-digitalocean-docker-compose-contexts)

#### Generate SSH Keys For Droplet
If you‚Äôre using Ubuntu on your local machine first check if you have an existing SSH key:
```sh
ls -l ~/.ssh/id_*.pub
```
If you don‚Äôt have any keys the output will say something along the lines of no matches found, otherwise you‚Äôll see the file path printed to the console.

To create a new key type the following and follow the interactive instructions. Adding a password is optional.
```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
```
You can now print the public key to your console with:
```sh
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# output:
ssh-rsa SOME_LONG_RANDOM_STRING_WITH_YOUR_USER_AT_THE_END
```
Add this key to your Droplet in the steps above so that you can SSH in as root.


#### Add a non-root ‚Äòuser‚Äô

Next create a non-root user to log into the server in future. First SSH into the server as root using the Droplet IP address (which you can view in your DigitalOcean dashboard):
```sh
ssh root@<droplet_ip_address>
```
If that doesn't connect you may need to run:
```sh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<path-to-private-key> root@<droplet-ip-address>
```
Add a new user, you can name the user whatever you like:
```sh
adduser <username>
```
Verify it created the user:
```sh
id <username>
```
Grant administrative privileges to the new user by adding them to the sudo group:
```sh
usermod -aG sudo <username>
```
Switch to the new user:
```sh
su <username>
```
Make an ssh directory on droplet:
```sh
sudo mkdir ~/.ssh
```
Change directory permissions:
```sh
sudo chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```
Allow the new user to SSH into the server by copying the .ssh directory into the new user directory. Use rsync to preserve the file permissions (don‚Äôt use cp):
```sh
sudo rsync --archive --chown=<username>:<username> ~/.ssh /home/<username>
```
#### Configure the firewall
Now set up a firewall using ufw and enable SSH connections. If you run ufw app list you should see OpenSSH listed in the output which is what we‚Äôll enable with:
```sh
ufw allow OpenSSH
```
Next enable the firewall:
```sh
ufw enable
```
Check that OpenSSH is enabled:
```sh
ufw status
# output:
Status: active
To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere 
```
Now that SSH connections are allowed we can safely log out as root and log in as our new user (who we‚Äôve set up with SSH keys in the previous step):
```sh
exit

# output:
logout
Connection to droplet_ip_address closed.
```

```sh
ssh <username>@<droplet_ip_address>
```
If that doesn't connect you may need to run:
```sh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<path-to-private-key> <username>@<droplet-ip-address>
```
Note: once you have your domain‚Äôs DNS records set up to point at DigitalOcean‚Äôs name servers you‚Äôll be able to SSH in with ssh deployer@yourdomain.com

#### Install & configure NGINX
NGINX will allow us to route web browser requests to our dockerized apps. To install it run:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install nginx
```
Note: we‚Äôre no longer logged in as root so we‚Äôll need to prefix most of our commands with sudo.

Now NGINX will show up in our ufw apps list and we can enable http, https or both (full). You generally only want to enable the minimum you require, however we‚Äôll be enabling https on our apps shortly so let‚Äôs enable Nginx Full:
```sh
sudo ufw app list
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw status

# output:
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
Nginx Full                 ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
Nginx Full (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```
Tip: you can use sudo ufw status verbose to view ports and additional firewall rules.

Now let‚Äôs check that NGINX is running correctly:
```sh
systemctl status nginx

# output:
# ...
Active: active (running) since...
```
And visiting http://droplet_ip_address should display the default NGINX ‚ÄúWelcome to nginx!‚Äù page.

Next edit the nginx.conf file with sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf (replace vim with your command line editor) and uncomment server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;:
```sh
http {
  ...
  server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
  # server_name_in_redirect off;
  ...
}
```
Save the file and check that there are no syntax errors:
```sh
sudo nginx -t

# output:
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```
And then restart NGINX:
```sh
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

#### Install Docker in Droplet

  ```sh
    sudo apt-get install \
        apt-transport-https \
        ca-certificates \
        curl \
        gnupg-agent \
        software-properties-common

    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

    sudo add-apt-repository \
        \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
        $(lsb_release -cs) \
        stable\"

    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
  ```

Make sure docker is installed:
  ```sh
    sudo docker -v
    # output:
    Docker version 19.03.8, build afacb8b7f0
  ```
And run the hello-world docker image as another test:
  ```sh
    sudo docker run hello-world

    # output:
    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
  ```

OPTIONAL: If you want to run docker commands without sudo, you can run the following commands:
  ```sh
    sudo groupadd docker

    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

    newgrp docker

    docker run hello-world
  ```

NOTE: You may need to also download docker compose for your local machine and droplet

#### Install docker-compose
To use docker-compose to deploy to remote servers with the `--context` argument we need to install release 1.26.0-rc2 or later. If the latest stable version here is under 1.26.0-rc2 then follow the instructions below, otherwise you can substitute the release number in the URL to the latest stable version. [Official installation docs can be found here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
```sh
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.26.0-rc2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```
Then check docker-compose is installed correctly:
```sh
docker-compose -v

# output:
docker-compose version 1.26.0-rc1, build 07cab513
```
